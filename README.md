### Development (Please read this to run JSON Server)

This projects are what I have created using the knowledge of what I have of react and the available time.

For React Dashboard SignUp and SignIn page I have created a fake db.json file, get the data from db.json

First install json server using "npm i -g json-server"
Then run the server from cmd using "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"

Note: Run only on port 3001 because I have set it as so.

If the server is not working or gives an error "File.. cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system"

Run the following line on your terminal
"Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -ScopeÂ CurrentUser"

Once JSON server is up and running you will be able to use SignIn SignUp Form.

For Graphs I used apexcharts library

For dynamic data I have used coingecko api for realtime  data.
There are only small changes to the data that you might observe.

Please Forgive me for the mess I have create in the code ;p
